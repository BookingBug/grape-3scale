# grape-3scale

## What is grape-3scale?
grape-3scale provides an autogenerated documentation for your [grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape)-API. The generated documentation is 3scale-compliant, meaning it can be used as the spec for 3scale Active Docs. This gem is a fork of grape-swagger (https://github.com/tim-vandecasteele/grape-swagger.git)

## Installation
grape-3scale is available as a gem, install it simply via the commandline:

```gem install grape-3scale```

or add to your Gemfile:

```gem 'grape-3scale'```

## Usage
Once you have the gem installed, mount all your different APIs (with ```Grape::API``` superclass) on a root node. In the root class definition, also include ```add_3scale_documentation```, this sets up the system and registers the documentation on '/3scale_doc.json'. Setup done, you can restart your local server now.


``` ruby
require 'grape-3scale'

module API
  class Root < Grape::API
    mount API::Cats
    mount API::Dogs
    mount API::Pirates
    add_3scale_documentation
  end
end
```

To use with Active Docs get the generated spec from http://localhost:3000/3scale_doc.json and upload to your 3scale admin portal either using the form on the api service edit page or via the API:

```
curl -v -X PUT -F "body=@YOUR_API_JSON_SPEC.json" "https://YOUR_ADMIN_DOMAIN/admin/api/active_docs/ID_OF_THE_SERVICE_SPEC.xml?provider_key=YOUR_PROVIDER_KEY"
```

## Configure
You can pass a hash with some configuration possibilities to ```add_3scale_documentation```, all of these are optional:
* ```:mount_path``` The path were the API documentation is loaded, default '/3scale_doc'
* ```:api_version``` Version of the API that's being exposed
* ```:base_path``` Basepath of the API that's being exposed
* ```:markdown``` Allow markdown in `notes`, default `false`
* ```:hide_documentation_path``` Don't show the '/3scale_doc' path in the generated 3scale documentation

## 3scale Header Parameters

3scale also supports the documentation of parameters passed in the header. Since grape's ```params[]``` doesn't return header parameters we can 
to specify header parameters seperately in a block after the description.

``` ruby
desc "Return super-secret information", {
  headers: {
    "XAuthToken" => {
      description: "Valdates your identity",
      required: true 
    },
    "XOptionalHeader" => {
      description: "Not reallly needed",
      required: false 
    }
  }
}
```

## 3scale additions
grape-3scale allows you to add an explanation in markdown in the notes field. Which would result in proper formatted markdown in Active Docs.

We're using [kramdown](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org) for parsing the markdown, specific syntax can be found [here](http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html).

Be sure to enable markdown in the `add_3scale_documentation` call: ':markdown => true'

``` ruby
desc "Reserve a virgin in heaven", {
  :notes => <<-NOTE
    Virgins in heaven
    -----------------

    > A virgin doesn't come for free

    If you want to reserve a virgin in heaven, you have to do
    some crazy stuff on earth.

        def do_good
          puts 'help people'
        end

    * _Will go to Heaven:_ Probably
    * _Will go to Hell:_ Probably not
  NOTE
}
```

## Contributing to grape-3scale

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
